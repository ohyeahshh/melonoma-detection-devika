<p class="mb-3 text-white font-semibold" style="width:900px; margin:30px auto;">There are over 200 different forms of cancer. Out of 200, Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages. The first step of Melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to conduct a visual examination of the skin's affected area. Dermatologists take the dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which have an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis without any additional technical support. With further visual examination by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnosis raised to 75-84% accuracy. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.</p>



    <p class="mb-3 text-white font-semibold" style="width:900px; margin:30px auto;">"Among all the skin cancer type, melanoma is the least common skin cancer, but it is responsible for 75% of death SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification, 2020. "</p>

<p class="mb-3 text-white font-semibold" style="width:900px; margin:30px auto;">The first step to identify whether the skin lesion is malignant or benign for a dermatologist is to do a skin biopsy. In the skin biopsy, the dermatologist takes some part of the skin lesion and examines it under the microscope. The current process takes almost a week or more, starting from getting a dermatologist appointment to getting a biopsy report. This project aims to shorten the current gap to just a couple of days by providing the predictive model using Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD). The approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from outlier lesions images. This reduction of a gap has the opportunity to impact millions of people positively.
